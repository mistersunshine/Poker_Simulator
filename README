QUICK INSTRUCTIONS

To run Simulation1 to output to log/simulation_results_log.txt:

php runsimulation.php

To run the unit tests:

php runallunittests.php

To create a simulation:

Extend BaseSimulation, define GetPremiumHands() and GetSubPremiumHands()
Example: class.Simulation1.php

NOTES

The log file simulation_results_log.txt is a raw output of data from the simulation. If the simulation is small (10 hands), you get verbose output for those hands. For all simulations, you get a count of how many of each hand was dealt and how often those hands won.

Currently this assumes the hand is completely played out with all hands, which does happen in limit Hold 'em.
